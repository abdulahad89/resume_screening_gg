# Resume Screening System - Google AI Only
# Simplified requirements for Google AI-only solution

# Core Streamlit
streamlit>=1.28.0
pandas>=1.5.0
numpy>=1.24.0

# Document Processing
PyMuPDF>=1.23.0
python-docx>=0.8.11

# Google AI Integration - ONLY DEPENDENCY WE NEED
google-generativeai>=0.3.0

# Utilities

# NOTE: Removed all these compared to hybrid version:
# - requests (no HuggingFace API needed)
# - nltk (Google AI handles NLP)
# - fuzzywuzzy (Google AI handles matching)
# - python-Levenshtein (not needed)
